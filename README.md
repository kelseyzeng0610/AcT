# Real-Time Action Recognition using Action Transformer (AcT)




A real-time human action recognition system implementing the Action Transformer (AcT) architecture for pose-based action classification using webcam input.






## Overview

This project implements a real-time human action recognition system that:
- Uses MediaPipe for pose estimation
- Processes live webcam feed for action recognition
- Implements temporal sequence modeling using Action Transformer
- Handles occlusions and low-visibility scenarios
- Provides real-time visual feedback

## Features

- Real-time pose estimation using MediaPipe
- Temporal sequence modeling for action recognition
- Adaptive confidence thresholding
- Temporal smoothing for stable predictions
- Support for both webcam and IP camera inputs

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
